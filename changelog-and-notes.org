** 2021-02-04 -- Initial function implemented for modulation and propagation
** 2021-02-05 -- Some issues with conversion to real space after modulation

 - I think that the math is more or less correct, but I am having issues that seem to be related to numerical problems.
 - By playing with the fftshifts I can make it better --> I have seen this kind of behavior before and think it is related to the way the fft algorithm interprets time-shifting.
 - Need to look through and make sure all fft's are performed in such a way that there is no large phase ramp
 - Need to also better understand how one can change the settings of the initial pulse to affect the spatial/spectral resolution of the output
 - On the plus side, the energy calculation is always great -- it totally makes sense -- the problem is only with re-creating the wavefunction amplitude envelope in real-space after propagating for some time after modulation
   - Even happens at time 0 so that means there has to be an issue with the numerical side of things.  
** 2021-02-06 -- Update on last note (2021-02-05) -- Issues Resolved/Understood

It seems that the changes I made in fft shifting at the end of the day yesterday were sufficient to solve all remaining problems.  

The current test script seems to completely check out and make sense.  

The reason you see some spatial modulation of the wavepacket even at time 0 is that we imparted the modulator as a phase gate in time -- not space.  

This assumption differs from the one in ropers, where they impart the phase modulator as a phase gate in space, not time.  

I think they both are basically two sides of the same problem... and converge when the electron moudlation depth is "perturbative" -- that  is when it is small you don't see the spatial modulations from the time-gate (and likely vice-a-versa if you looked at the effect on the temporal nature of the wavepacket from a spatial phase modulation)...

I think that in the end the approximation I make in this code is more accurate.  Why?  Because the modulator is thin and acts on the wavepacket in time as it passes through.  To think of it as a pure space gate implies that as it passes to the other side, there is no spatial reshaping of the wavepacket.  That likely is not true, but I think the models that I am making here would capture this effect.  

What this model is not accounting for is that the real modulators will not be perfectly thin relative to the wavepacket, and will act as a function of both space and time!!!  So basically, each model has this approximation baked in -- either they act all in space or all in time.  

After testing -- I think it is time to wrap up the scripts for converting back into real-space inside of a function and tidy up the code.  
* Tasks
** TODO Real-Space conversion function

Create function to convert wavefunction back to real-space after modulation for each time step.  

Tidy up the remaining test code into a script.
